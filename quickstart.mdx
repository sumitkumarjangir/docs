## Setup

Learn how to automatically install, integrate and setup any library in your code by just running one command.

#### Step 1
Fill the this form to get early access to Codact. You will recieve the package and the installation information via mail.

#### Step 2
How to install and setup any package in your project.

```bash
codact install <package_name> -p <prompt> -f <relative_file_path>
```

#### Parameters:
`package_name` - The package name that you want to install eg. stripe, etc.

`-p or prompt` - Any special instruction that you want to pass like the integration should happen in some way or it should create an API with it or more.

`-f or relative_file_path` - The file where you want to add the changes to. It is an relative file path.

#### Example:

```bash
codact install stripe -p "add rest endpoint" -f "app.py"
```

It will install the stripe package in your project and will also update your app.py file to setup it and add an rest endpoint.


#### Step 3
How to debug any command.

```bash
codact debug -r <run_command>
```

#### Parameters:

`-r` - The run command you want to debug like `pip install requirements.txt`

#### Example:

```bash
codact debug -r "python app.py"
```

This command will debug your run command i.e. `puthon app.py` and will output in logs if there is any issues and will provide resolutions for the same.
